Which of the following are true when running the same alpabet and frequencies through 2 different implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm?

All symbols in the alpabet will have the same length encoding.

The length of coded message will be the same

All coding will have a unique prefix

Symbols will have either will have the same encoding or the bitwise not of the encoding(1101 or 0010)

All Symbols in the alpabet will have the same encoding

The entire encoing will be identical
